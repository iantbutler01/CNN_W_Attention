Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red <NAME/> certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red <NAME/> expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

Mr. Giordano:

We have received the executed copies of the ISDA Master Agreements for the referenced counterparties, however, we still need to receive the supporting documentation set forth in my letters transmitting the execution copies to you.

For Catequil Partners, L.P., we need to receive items 1-5 set forth in my transmittal letter of 10/11/01 (copy attached).


		 

For Catequil Overseas Partners Ltd., we need to receive items 1-5 set forth in my transmittal letter of 10/11/01 (copy attached).

			 

We look forward to receiving these documents as soon as possible, so that we can close our files.  Thank you for your assistance and, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.

trip to steamboat:
Jan. 13-19 $425 a night for a house that sleeps 10.
That works out to $500 a couple for the week(6 nights).  That will give us 5 days to ski(or 4 on 1 off).
Continental flys directly to Steamboat for $300 roundtrip.
Need to know interest level ASAP. We have to pay 50% upon booking the house and %50 within 30 days of arrival.
I will pay the %50 up front, I just want a firm committment that you will be going.

Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what <NAME/> put me and my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?  Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to <NAME/>?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.  I hope that helps

Thanks again,

I had been meaning to reply to your message you sent to <NAME/> and me a few weeks ago, after you showed us the houses on Winter Wheat.  I saw this morning that 66 Winter Wheat had an option pending =(   I love that house!  But, we are not in a position yet to make a decision about moving, so I guess it wasn't meant to be.

I just wanted to let you know that we appreciated you coming out to show us some homes the other weekend and following-up so promptly with your e:mail on other houses.  If we do decide that we're coming to the Woodlands, we will be calling you to look for a house.  We really enjoyed meeting you and think that it would be great to work with you to look for a home.

Next time you talk to <NAME/> Gras would you pass along my phone number and email.  I am anxious to correspond with her and see where she is in the process and her thoughts about travel plans.
 
I know that the adoption agency wants to group the Taraz families together for court dates/travel.

Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by
New York State Regulators

(London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's
leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as
complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long
Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's
formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580-
megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks-
off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.

International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy
facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of
New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the
State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses
all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project,
including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.

"The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long
Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said <NAME/>
Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. "We are planning to
begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and
expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added.

Notes to Editors-

The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of
industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66
and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When
completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million
homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to
the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.

International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric
generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net)
under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,
Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was
created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading
independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock
Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges
is "IPR".

Guys --

We need to quickly put together some talking points on how to respond to AEP's request for delay until 2003.  My understanding is that AEP in Texas is wholly outside of ERCOT (if wrong - please inform).  

AEP needs only to file a good amendment to the FERC OATT (or SPP needs to do it for them) ASAP.  My basic model for provisioning of energy for retail competition in non-ERCOT Texas is that delivery to the border of the OATT provider (for instance delivering a into-Entergy product into Arkansas and paying for losses would be sufficient for delivery into the Woodlands).

<NAME/> was going to call Luiz to get this issue on the burner.

8 State Power Contracts Seen as Bad Deals
Energy: The long-term pacts require the purchase of too much electricity at too high a price for too long, a study finds. Immediate renegotiation is urged.
By VIRGINIA ELLIS and NANCY VOGEL
Times Staff Writers

September 30 2001

SACRAMENTO -- At least eight of the long-term contracts to buy electricity that California officials signed this year are so egregious that they should immediately be renegotiated, according to a new, detailed study. 

The biggest problems are so-called "take or pay" clauses that require the state to buy large quantities of expensive power even if there is no demand for it, the study said. 

The contracts will saddle Californians with high electricity rates for the next decade because the state negotiated many deals that require the purchase of too much energy at too high a price, according to the analysis, which was sponsored by a coalition of consumer, environmental and renewable energy groups. 

Between January and September, the state Department of Water Resources entered into 53 agreements to buy electricity for customers of the state's three investor-owned utilities, which have been unable to buy power on their own. The longest of the contracts would last 20 years, and overall, the pacts are estimated to cost $43 billion over the next two decades. 

Power generators did not rule out the possibility of renegotiating at least some contracts, but said any move to do so would have to be requested by the state. 

"If we receive a request and it makes sense for both parties to restructure the contracts, we will consider it," said Joe Ronan, a senior vice president for San <NAME/>-based Calpine Corp. But, he said, the company has "no intention of asking for renegotiation" on its own. 

Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers, a trade association for electricity generating companies, said other members of his group might also consider renegotiation. So far, he said, "I don't see any realistic legislative or regulatory efforts to push it in that direction." 

And he said the producers would oppose any efforts to force them back to the bargaining table. "We'd take strong exception to involuntary renegotiations," he said. 

For his part, Gov. Gray <NAME/> would be open to renegotiations, said his spokesman, <NAME/> Maviglio, but only if power generators show a willingness to return to the bargaining table. 

"Would we love to get a better deal?" Maviglio said. "Of course we would, but the contracts we negotiated helped us get in the positive position we are in now, and if the generators were willing to renegotiate the contracts, we'd be the first ones at the table." 

S. <NAME/> <NAME/>, who led the contract talks last winter on behalf of the state, said critics miss the larger purpose of the agreements. When the state began negotiating contracts, California had just suffered two days of rotating blackouts. The contracts tamed the market and eliminated the blackout threat, he said. 

"Insurance is insurance, and it costs a little bit," said <NAME/>, "but it's a good thing to have." 

But <NAME/> B. <NAME/>, chief economist for JBS Energy, which conducted the three-month study, noted that at least one of the most troublesome agreements was signed in July--weeks after the market had stabilized and prices had declined. 

The study of the contracts was sponsored by the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies and was financed by a $200,000 grant from the San <NAME/>-based Energy Foundation. It was conducted by JBS, a consulting group. 

The study singled out for criticism: 

* A deal with Sempra Energy, parent company to San <NAME/> Gas and Electric, which <NAME/> called the most expensive and inflexible of all the contracts. Over the life of the pact, he calculated, Sempra would earn $1.2 billion more than the California Energy Commission estimates unregulated power should cost. 

The contract lasts until 2011. For each year, it requires the state to buy large amounts of power at fixed prices whether it's needed or not. 

* A deal to buy electricity from small Northern California power plants owned by Calpine Co. that have yet to be built. The plants will be "peakers," designed to run in short bursts when electricity supplies are tight, such as on hot summer afternoons. The state agreed to pay Calpine $90 million a year for five years simply for the right to buy 495 megawatts of electricity. 

"They get $90 million a year on plants that cost $250 million," said <NAME/>. "That's huge. You get your money out in three years. If a utility had built these power plants, they would have charged half as much." 

* A deal with Alliance-<NAME/> LLC to buy the output of two inefficient peaker power plants in San Bernardino County. The deal commits the state to pay $207 million through 2010 whether or not it uses any of the 72 megawatts of electricity. 

* An agreement to pay $150 per megawatt-hour for two years--more than twice the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour of all the contracts--for power from several aging plants that Mirant Corp. of Atlanta owns in the San <NAME/> Bay Area. 

* A contract the state signed in July to buy power from Pacificorp, a private utility based in Portland, Ore. Pacificorp agreed to sell electricity at a fixed price of $70 per megawatt-hour. That price could have looked reasonable at the height of last winter's crisis, but it was double what energy sold for when the contract was signed. 

* Contracts with two power marketing companies for electricity generated by the same Southern California plants. The difference in price shows what a poor deal the state got under one of the contracts, the study said. 

One of the marketers, Allegheny Energy Supply Co., agreed to sell from 150 to 1,000 megawatts from March 2001 to December 2011 for a straight $61 per megawatt-hour. 

But a second marketer, <NAME/> Energy Marketing and Trading Co. got a nine-year contract to sell from 35 to 600 megawatts from the same plants for $62.50 to $87 per megawatt-hour. 

"When you compare those two contracts," <NAME/> said, "you know you've got a dog here. I think <NAME/> showed up earlier, and the state was desperate." 

* An agreement with Dynegy Corp. of <NAME/> that requires the state to pay for emissions credits and upgrading of pollution control equipment on the firm's California-based plants. The contract puts no ceiling on those costs, <NAME/> said, and it is unclear how high they are likely to go. 

* A pact to buy electricity from a plant being built in Victorville by a partnership between Inland Energy of Newport Beach and Constellation Power Development of Baltimore. The state agreed to a price of $58 per megawatt-hour, but is obligated to take all of the power, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

<NAME/>, a Harvard-trained economist who has 23 years of experience with electricity and gas utility issues, said the brunt of the financial pain from the contracts will not be felt by consumers until after the next election, when the pacts significantly increase the amount of power the state buys. He said 96% of all the electricity purchased under the contracts becomes available--much of it on a take or pay basis--after next summer. 

Those large power buys will come when the state is expected to have energy surpluses because of increasing supply and a decline in demand driven by higher prices. 

"The state has agreed to buy too much power, often for too long a period, at too high a price, and much of this power is simply too dirty," said V. <NAME/> White, executive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "To make matters worse, almost all of these contracts are dependent on one price-volatile fuel: natural gas." 

When the state began negotiating contracts in January, electricity prices averaged $177 per megawatt-hour and sometimes spiked higher than $1,000 per megawatt-hour. By June, the average price had fallen below $100. Lately, prices hover around $30 per megawatt-hour, similar to the cost California enjoyed before prices went haywire. 

<NAME/> was particularly critical of one element of the Pacificorp contract: a clause that prevents the state from taking advantage of the plummeting price of natural gas until after 2003. The price of natural gas, the main fuel used to run power plants in California, began to jump last fall but has plummeted since spring. 

Another weakness of the contracts, <NAME/> said, is that they lock the state into further dependence on gas. For the prices California will pay under these pacts, residents could have made a greater investment in power generated by the sun, wind or other renewable sources for the same price or cheaper, he said. 

Windmills and solar panels would help buffer against natural gas price spikes, he said. Renewable sources of power also don't release air pollution and gases that contribute to global warming, he added. 

"I'm paying to buy something that really isn't the right thing to buy," <NAME/> said. 

"I don't want to pay <NAME/> $69 a megawatt-hour to generate lots of inefficient gas-fired power that I have to take that's going to increase global warming and increase pollution in the South Coast Air Basin."

In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:

The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.
These numbers must be preceded by the correct "Ocean Code."
From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).
From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).
I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.

It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.

Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.

<NAME/>:  Comments looks good.  My only comment is that, in our view, the price cap (which would cover ALL capacity in the secondary market) is simply bad economic policy and won't address any problems--in fact it will only create problems. (From a practical perspective, I'm not even sure that the Commission can successfully "regulate" prices in the secondary market.)
 
<NAME/> the commission change the price cap provisions of the decision based comments advising against them?  Very unlikely.  
 
But when the caps create problems (and they will), I want to have been on record advising the Commission of why caps are bad economic policy and pointing out the bad outcomes that caps will cause.  I think that it's very important to point out the downside of caps and to be on record against them.  
 
That said, I don't want the comments to be so negative as to cloud support for the decision; nor do I think the Commission will change the cap based on our comments.  Other than that, EES and ENA can sign on.  Anyone have any objections to pointing out the fact that price caps are ill-advised?

<NAME/> called last night - some problem with SO2 marks.  <NAME/> thought that our curves were way off.  Sounds as if that is not the problem but instead that the book in which these deals were put had previously housed only intercompany deals and not third party deals.  Book wasn't picked up in Credit's exposure, making it look as if we were off on our mark versus Barclay's mark by $20MM.  I have gotten one story from <NAME/>.

<NAME/>,
   I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red <NAME/>.
   I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.

not necessarily looking for predictive power.  that's a 3 year project.  just for market making skillset.  The work that <NAME/> Forster did was just for front month.  That creates month 1.  Then, similar logic has to create a month 1/month 2 spread to create a month 2 outright market.   Same for month 2/ month 3 to create month 3.  There might be 24-36 individual markets to create a forward curve.  Sometimes month 1 has correlation to the month 1/ month 2 spread.  Sometimes it does not.  Must create a system that is mechanical but very easy for a human to add bias.

FYI - You may want to review the process for managing stacks on EOL and be certain that those to whom access is granted is in compliance with the list of authorized traders maintained by RAC.  I don't think that RAC needs to have approval, but we should be cross referencing requests to manage stacks on EOL with the approved trader list.  This may be part of your process.  If not, it probably should be incorporated.  Then you may want to educate the RAC team on your approval process.  Let me know if you need and help or support from me.

The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.  But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.

I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
<NAME/> Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer mailto::btansey@sfchronicle.
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San <NAME/> Chronicle /chronicle/info/copyrigh
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer <NAME/> Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like <NAME/> Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant <NAME/> <NAME/>. <NAME/> said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said <NAME/>, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
<NAME/> <NAME/>, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

Purchases to fill this short should be put in the short-term Northwest book.  Buy from whomever and notify PGE Real-Time Merchant of the supply.

2.  Friday, August 17, and Saturday, August 18 we are 45 MW short for HE 1-6 and HE 23-24, and 27 MW short for HE 7-22 to Portland General at the MID-C.  Supplier should be at the Mid-C.  Purchases to fill this short should be put in the short-term Northwest book.  Buy from whomever and notify PGE Real-Time Merchant of the supply.

3.  For Friday, August 17 we have 100 MW for HE 07-23 delivered to Portland General at their system (Puget->BPA->PGE).  This is supply for a schedule we will have going to NCPA at COB (PGE->Enron->PGE Trans->NCPA).  The tags have been built already (30070 for Friday and 30071 for Saturday) and are pending.  You will have to implement them at the appropriate time.  You do not need to notify Puget or BPA.  Just coordinate the schedule between PGE and NCPA.

We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1, 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the postal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., <NAME/>, TX 77002.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

Drew,

If TW cannot sell all of the Mavrix capacity within 60 days, then will TW then take the financial risk after this time and not hold Mavrix responsible for the difference? This may be OK as we may wish to re-sell the capacity in different packages of time.   KW.

Hi Evie:
 
Two quick things:
 
1) My understanding is that the PUC has denied the applications for rehearing.  There's a group that is fixing to take it to the court of appeals level--can't see any downside ( a) argument is that the PUC erred in its decisionmaking--no record, no facts, no evidence, etc., and that it needs to go back to the drawing board and get the process right before it suspends anything--and b) the heavy-lifting was already done getting the app. for rehrng prepared).  Seems like getting a chance to re-argue at the PUC has alot of positives.  Were you planning on doing anything?
 
2) I want to talk to <NAME/> Alcantar about some interesting QF ideas, but wanted to check with you first.  Frankly, I'm ignorant as to whether that still occupies a big spot on his plate, if he represents the same folks, etc., and thought I'd check with you first.
 
<NAME/> (all things considered) you're doing well.
 
Best,
<NAME/>

J,  I don't have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept.  I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.  I'll keep working Dot to see if she and <NAME/> are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.  I suspect <NAME/> and <NAME/> will be no go for anytime in 02.  If Dot and <NAME/> are game then we can talk with D and T and P and J about meeting <NAME/> and <NAME/> to make our party and even 8.  If Dot and <NAME/> are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.

<NAME/>/<NAME/> - One line item on the TW counterparty revenue summary probably requires explanation.  The report shows a net $4.2 million payment to PGandE for transportation.  This is because PGandE released capacity at rates in excess of the maximum rate due TW -- thus PGandE was due a credit.  This was not a liability to TW, as the other side of this capacity release is embedded in the revenues paid to TW by other counterparties.

Shipments of market pulp to <NAME/> totaled 462,157 tonnes in September, down 0.6% compared with August shipments, according to a report last week by <NAME/>'s Materials Information Center.Despite the month-to-month decline last month, market pulp imports into <NAME/> year-to-date have climbed 33% vs. the same period last year. From January to September 2001, imports have totaled 3.54 million tonnes, reported <NAME/>'s general administration of customs. This might indicate that the Chinese buyers have plenty of stocks available and might slow down their purchasing patterns.


Weak market in the pulp industry continues to push producers into taking further downtime. As expected the bulk of downtime is taken by the Canadian producers who face the highest producing costs.  Today NorskeCanada announced it will take additional curtailment at all four of its BC pulp and paper divisions during the fourth quarter to reflect the continuing difficult market conditions.The company said it will curtail paper production by 60,000 tonnes (including 38,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp production by 23,600 tonnes in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter curtailment brings accumulated total paper curtailment for 2001 to 166,000 tonnes (including 112,000 tonnes of newsprint) and pulp curtailment to 121,000 tonnes.

Greetings.  Well, it's about over for the company known as <NAME/>.  Ultimately I, and just about everyone else, am going to need to find a new job.

It's a shame that such a fun, interesting and bright group of people that had a very successful core franchise are now in such a messy situation due to a handful of folks who exercised (at a minimum) extremely poor judgment.  But it is what it is.  As for me, I'm dusting off my resume and getting ready to send it around. I've already had a few calls from "inquiring minds," so we'll we where things end up.  Thanks so much for the thoughts. Definitely crazy times, but I'm not getting to worked up about it.  And besides, Prentice has accepted PWC's offer, so I'm looking forward to housekeeping!

The current exemption is $675,000.  So that means that the first $675,000 of an estate is tax free.  Anything over that is taxed at 55%, but you are allowed deductions such as debts, probate fees, funeral expenses, and any state estate or inheritance taxes.  So the effective rate will be a little lower.  The increase to $1 million will not take effect until 2006.  This is very basic information, estate planning should be handled by a professional to minimize the tax liability.  Obviously, if the estate is not worth much money, then no taxes will be owed.  I'm sure these professionals are highly compensated because they have the ability to save millions of dollars to some of their clients.

<NAME/> loves it when you are at his games.  He was pretty proud of his play at second base.

Hi Honey,

I hope you are having a good day, I sure enjoyed playing a bit this morning. (Although I had a little bout of blue bush) I just love having you around all the time. 

I don't want turkey for dinner, and since it's payday, I wanna take us out to dinner. Where would you like to go?  Or we can be turds again tonight and to to YOKO's tomorrow, or whatever.

I am suddenly actually busy figuring out the estate VS the newcompany stuff, it is fun to be busy and needed.

I love you very much and can't wait to see you tonight to show you the new license!

Love,

<NAME/> Freeland

Hi <NAME/>!

I am glad that your family is well.  My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC.  I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.

I will be glad to bring the tape in.  I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk.  We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor.  

I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too.  Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses.  I will bring it as well. 

Thanks and take care.  <NAME/>.

I have reviewed the term sheet and I am fine with the form.  

I did spot a potential issue with the Transport piece of the proposal.  If ENA holds transport on NNG, it cannot simply sell use of that capacity to Unocal.  The shipper of record with NNG needs to hold title to the gas that is being transported.  For Unocal to utilize this capacity, they would need to either directly contract with NNG for such capacity, or ENA would acquire the capacity then "Capacity Release" the capacity to Unocal.  The Capacity Release would be subject to NNG bulletin board posting requirements.    Let me know if you want to discuss further.

Claudio,

I am still in the process of setting up what we are going to look at and how, but it will very definitely be options focused. I think the three major drivers we will care about will be Gas, Power, and weather. I am particularly interested in the relationship of how gas and power prices react with weather. One trade I am interested in is gas daily options that knock-in based on an observed temperature for the particular delivery point. What are your views and what would you focus on if you were me ?

Sorry for the delay.  My wallet and checkbook were stolen on Fr night and I spent all day yesterday getting things in order...after the thief charged $6000 on my credit and debit cards!  Remember that conversation we had about 2001.
 
I did little research on Compuserve and AOL.  Both have acess numbers in Almaty Kazaknstan -- where I'll be at least 1 week of my journey.  Looks like they both use the same access numbers and both charge a $6 connect fee.  So I don't see the advantage of adding AOL -- unless you see something I don't.  Here's the catch -- neither has service from Moscow.  So I'll be out of lunch in Moscow unless I can find an alternative ISP.  
 
I'm at regional type hotels in Kazakstan.  But, I'm staying at the Grand Marriott in Moscow.  Surely they have some sort of ISP access.
 
My current ISP is Compuserve.  Mail address:  cormanerb@cs.com mailto::cormanerb@cs.;  User:  cormanerb;  password:  chad4erb.  I currently have version 5.0 loaded -- there is a 6.0 available but I haven't had a chance to download.

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.

  
1.	Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date 	between July 1 and September 20th.  

2.	Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.

3.	No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the 	suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)

4.	Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  	Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, 	and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. 

Key risks associated with each category:
Adverse to P/L 
Adverse to hedge (demand risk)

14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report

    By <NAME/> White
    QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the "precarious" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.
    But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.
    The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.
    "We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society," said the chairman of the task force, <NAME/> Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.
    "As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada," Larose added.
    The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.
    "We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message," said <NAME/> Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.
    The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.
    It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.
    The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired. It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French, delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years, and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French.
    About 82 percent of Quebec's six million people describe French is their mother tongue. French has been Quebec's official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs, although other languages may also appear. Quebec has 1.4 million people whose first language is not French.
    Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec, which has held two referendums on separating from Canada. In the last one, in 1995, Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor-thin margin.
    English and French have been Canada's two official languages since 1969, with both languages spoken widely throughout the nation's history

You have two cows.  You borrow 80% of the forward value of the two cows from your bank, then buy another cow with 5% down and the rest financed by the seller on a note callable if your market cap goes below $20B at a rate 2 times prime. You now sell three cows to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at a 2nd bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more and this transaction process is upheld by your independent auditor and no Balance Sheet provided with the press release that announces that <NAME/> as a major owner of cows will begin trading cows via the Internet site COW (cows on web).

Dear Mom,

I just want you to know that I love you VERY much.  You still mean as much to me now as ever. I am your family whether I am married to <NAME/> or not.  You are an example of kindness and giving, and one of the most special women on the planet as far as I am concerned.

I have been kind of keeping quiet because I know how much <NAME/> needs you right now, and I don't want to say anything that would diminish him in your eyes. Part of the reason that I waited as long as I did to do this is that I desperately wanted one last family Thanksgiving where nobody has to choose who can come or feel strange or anything. 

<NAME/> has decided to stay with <NAME/> and <NAME/>, and just come up to deal with the vending machines.  I am glad, things are very tense and weird.  I just want to get everything settled. He seems like he is getting angry, and I don't like that.  He told me he wants me to keep the truck instead of the car because everytime he looks at the truck he feels like it is a betrayal. I got him this truck to help him with his business. Wanna buy a brand new truck?

Anyway,  it will all work out and we will all get thru this .  I have a new cell phone number, please feel free to call me, and I will probably call you tonight just to touch base and let you know I love you.

Stations 3,4 and 5.  I spoke with <NAME/> Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to <NAME/> <NAME/> of the Navajo Nation. Although <NAME/> is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  <NAME/> said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.

Drew and <NAME/>,

	<NAME/> Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at <NAME/> Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for <NAME/> Fastow.

It looks good!  I had a few comments on pages 7 and 9.

Also, on page 13 - # 26 and 27, is there any benefit to more specifically describing why we "understood" and why they "knew" that the San <NAME/> lateral contract would be base loaded due to their long-term firm supply arrangement with Pan <NAME/> that existed prior to and after the Global Settlement rates were negotiated?  FERC is aware of this longstanding and complex arrangement involving PGT, NWPL, TW, Pan <NAME/>, SoCal and SoCal's affiliate, PITCO.  It would seem a huge oversight on SoCal's part that this lower rate they supposedly negotiated and agreed to with TW was not memorialized in the Global Settlement or in TW's tariff.  This is a rate that applies to two-thirds of the volumes SoCal transports under contract 8255 and allegedly SoCal and TW had some verbal agreement (with a 10 year term) that would apply to these volumes.

I didn't go to Colorado.  My son had a baseball game and I had been out of town over the weekends lately so we sold the tickets.

I think Brown really made a mistake by going with <NAME/> <NAME/> against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.

I need a presentation prepared for this meeting with Lay and Skilling.   It should be very straight forward with a demand picture by region and supply picture by region.   Maps with the regional reliability councils noted and overall supply/demand from 96 to 2000 should be the basis for the presentation.

Maps and graphs are very useful.   The presentation should be very macro in scope.

I would work with Gasill's group to make the presentations for gas and power somewhat similar.

Please look at Sheet 1(2).  You will see there are numbers Lee attribute to You and I.  I wanted to go over the months that there is a large difference - see what counter parties make up the difference so that we can determine the absolute correct number for him.  I also wanted to discuss OA if we have time.  I have a 10:30 meeting and if you need to get back to the auditors, we can address at a later date.  Thanks.

Just so we're clear.  To say that it would not be a problem for very large tranches of customers to leave the system as part of "community aggregation,"  and then say it WOULD be a problem for individual customers to do the same, is, well, ridiculous.  In short, if you can work out the terms and conditions under which potentially huge tranches can go DA, then it is certainly feasible to do the same thing for individual customers. Finally, we're checking, but it seems that it will be be extremely difficult to say that its legally kosher for the PUC to permit DA under 9X, but suspend all other DA.  Very interesting.

Hey there,

Mom, can you forward this on to <NAME/>.

I am going to forward you our flight itenary from home this weekend.  We leave at 9:30am on sunday.  We are going to go into <NAME/> sat morning and then will stop by <NAME/>'s on Saturday to prep the yard and set up any necessary stuff for the dogs.  We will drop the dogs off though on Sunday morning very early.  I don't want to leave them there overnight for the first night by themselves...though usually they are fine to stay by themselves...I just want to make sure that the yard will be secure.  

The company we are going with is called Alaska Discovery.  Their website is www.akdiscovery.com  .  We will be staying at their inn on the days prior and after our actual expedition.  The trip we are doing is called the Glacier Bay Expedition....trip start date being the 11th.  On the 19th we fly back to seattle and will have to stay there overnight.  Our return flight to <NAME/> is wed the 20th at 6ish in the morning and we will both be coming into work when we get in.  We will pick up the dogs that evening.

I am going to leave <NAME/> my cell phone bc the tags on the dogs have that phone number on it.  To get into the voice mail just dial the phone number  713-516-0651 ....and the password is 1743.  The dogs eat together and share 1 1/2 coffee cans full of dog food once a day.  They eat in the evening.  Pearl takes medication twice a day and one of them is supposed to be taken with food.  We usually just give her a few treats in the am with the pill.  We will leave treats along with the food.  

I think that is about it.  Thanks again for taking care of the dogs.  We really appreciate it.  I will call before and after we are in the woods to check up on things and we will pick them up wednesday evening.

Talk to you later.  Mom, <NAME/> and I will come by before we leave.  Probably Saturday evening.

SAO PAULO, Brazil, Oct 15, 2001 (Reuters) - Brazilian paper and pulp maker Industrias Klabin Papel e Celulose SA said on Monday it would restructure its units in a cost-cutting drive it hopes will save 60 million reais ($22 million) per year. 
Klabin, one of Brazil's top producers of paper, tissue and wood pulp, will incorporate its Klamasa, KIV, Industrias Klabin and Igaras units under its subsidiary Klabin Riocell SA , the company said in a statement. 
Riocell will remain the sole publicly held company in the group and will be renamed Klabin SA. Minority shareholders in Klabin will be given shares in Riocell at par, Klabin's Director General Josemar Verillo told Reuters. 
The restructuring, to be completed by December, should reduce administrative, operational, financial and tax costs. It will also improve operating synergies, allow for a better use of financial resources and improve the group's transparency for investors, Klabin said. 
"We have a lot of business between the group. That leads to operational and financial inefficiencies," Verillo said. 
The company said it expects to save about 60 million reais ($22 million) per year and could trim staff in the long term as a result of the restructuring. 
In a separate statement responding to an inquiry by the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Klabin said its consolidated net revenues would be 10 percent higher in 2001, driven by exports and a depreciation of Brazil's currency. The company posted net revenues of 1.9 billion reais ($684 million) in 2000.

I don't recall making this request.  Who did you hear this from?  Maybe that person could shed light on this for both of us.

There was some confusion among the HR groups a couple of weeks ago with the name that was assigned to your cost center for accounting purposes - didn't match the organizational name that is used for your group.  I wonder if that is where this is coming from?  <NAME/> (whose last name I don't know) who works for <NAME/> Jones in HR was in the midst of the confusion.  The RC name that was used had "IBS" in it and was rather long, but didn't obviously seem to relate to your team.  Question was whether or not this RC reported in through Operations.  When I asked <NAME/> to read me the names of employees in that RC, it included <NAME/> Reeves and her team.  I told her that we had not used the term "IBS" in a while.  <NAME/> asked if the RC name should be consistent with the organizational name of the group.  I said that makes sense and she said she would follow up on that.  But that should have been a name change, not the opening of a new cost center.  See if any of this info gets us back on the right track.  --<NAME/>

SUMMARY OF THE DRAFT RATE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PUC AND DWR


The Bond Structure
? Keeps the state in the power selling business for 15 years - the life of
the bonds - because the bonds are repaid solely from the state's power
purchase revenues and no other repayment source.
? Designed as a "net revenue bond," meaning bondholders are paid last and
all other DWR costs and expenses are paid first.  In order to sell net
revenue bonds, DWR must show that it has guaranteed revenues to both: (1)
carry out its entire operations and (2) generate enough profit to pay off
the bonds.  As a result, the rating of a net revenue bond depends on the
overall financial health of the company - in this case, a guarantee that the
overall power purchase program instituted by DWR will be paid for by
ratepayers for 15 years.
? Requires that California's current energy policies and programs are set in
place and not subject to further political or policy changes for at least
the next 15 years and that the continued operation of this program will
generate enough income to meet all the program's possible financial needs
for the life of the bonds.  
? Ratepayers will pay for the state's power purchase program as long as the
bonds are outstanding.


The Rate Agreement
? Requires the Commission to adjust rates in 45 to 90 days when DWR sends
over a revenue requirement.  The Commission is limited only to correcting
mathematical error or costs outside the agreement's scope.  If the
Commission does not adjust rates according to DWR's estimated revenue
calculations, the Bond Trustee may enforce bondholders' rights to have rates
established at a level that satisfies DWR.
? May require the Commission to require all utilities to take DWR's power
and deliver it to customers in their service territories before the
utilities sell their own, often lower cost power to customers in each
service territory. 
? Precludes utilities from returning to the business of providing 100% of
their customers' electricity needs for the life of the bonds because the
state must stay in the business of buying and selling power to meet the
requirements of a net revenue bond.  Guarantees DWR receives whatever
revenue it needs for all of its power programs and establishes the State in
the power business for at least 15 years, the life of the bonds.  
? Because the bonds can be repaid only from DWR sales, suggests the need to
change the Legislatively imposed mandate that DWR's program "sunset" at the
end of 2002.   Already, the financial community has expressed concern about
this provision.  In response, DWR's comments on the Rate Agreement suggested
that an extension of the sunset by Executive Order could allow DWR to
continue purchasing power in a way that would be funded through
Commission-approved revenue requirements.
? Provides generators, who negotiated long-term contracts with the state
during the very height of the energy crisis when market power was being
exercised, irrevocable 15-year assurances that those power purchase deals
will be treated as solidly as if they were loans from the generators to the
State.
? Interferes with Federal or other court efforts to review the long-term
contracts entered into by the state.  Because the existence of those
contracts is essential to the continuation of the bond deal, the state would
not be able to take advantage of any change in circumstance or law that
would reduce dependence on disadvantageous long-term contracts.
? The Commission must also enforce rules so that utilities can bill and
collect on DWR's behalf, and customers are subject to disconnection for
failure to pay for electricity provided by DWR.
? Constitutes irrevocable financing document - the Commission may not alter
or modify any of its provisions without DWR's agreement.  DWR will likely
need to obtain bondholder approval before agreeing to any changes.  Remains
in effect as long as the bonds are outstanding, regardless of how many bonds
are issued.   


The Challenges to the Rate Agreement
? Eleven parties filed comments opposed to the Rate Agreement.
? Received comments in support only from DWR, the office of the State
Treasurer, and the investment bank underwriting the bond transaction.
? Received strong opposition citing numerous flaws with the rate agreement,
including:
	o The Commission cannot make the iron-clad guarantee to meet DWR's
revenue requirement 
	o Unconstitutional, contrary to general principles of utilities law,
and outside the scope of AB 1X, the statute that allows DWR to buy power  
	o DWR has acted illegally and the Commission's actions are illegal
because they rely on allegedly improper conduct on the part of DWR
Oppose the requirement that the Commission must ensure that DWR has the
physical ability to stay in business using the utilities distribution
networks.

While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  

I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

um, yeah, i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 8 year statistic! but i'm not sure what relevance that really has.  it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve, it seems like you've been together forever.  it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say, hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result?  it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point.  of course, however you want to handle it is fine by me.  well, if you get this while you are in portland or sf, give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can, otherwise, call or write and let's stay in touch.  good luck shopping for programs.

<NAME/>,
    I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".  I just don't know if we'll be ready.  I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.  Also, <NAME/> wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.  Therefore, I'd like to start getting <NAME/> DeSpain involved.  Does that make sense?

<NAME/>,

Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions?  I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly.  

Here is my situation.  I purchased a 32 acre tract in <NAME/> about 8 months ago.  I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th.  

I expect to realize a gain of around $400,000.  See calculations below:

Sales price:		2,100,000
Purchase price		1,200,000
FeesandDevel costs	  500,000

Profit			 400,000

The cash generated at the sale will be close to $1 million after repayment of a loan.

I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange.

I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify. 

 First, there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner, Ltd for $1.15 million six months ago.  I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project.  We could not come to terms for the development, so the partnership was conveyed to me.  The loan still exist.  I am an 80% limited partner.  Another investor is the other limited partner.  We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner.  We intend to develop the property. Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange?

Second,  I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $400,000.  I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing.  I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually, but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP.

If neither of these deals qualify, I would still like to find another piece of property.  My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name.  Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity?

Thank you in advance for your help.

Thanks again for the stuff.  I can take it from here.  Two quick questions.
1) Is there anything that's top secret that I shouldn't be talking about?
2) Do we have anything for LNG activity similar to the slides on incremental interstate pipeline capacity?

Thanks again.  I'll let you know if anything interesting comes up.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
<NAME/> Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

<NAME/>
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to <NAME/> Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   <NAME/> continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  <NAME/>'t want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  <NAME/> allocate prorata.  <NAME/> use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (<NAME/> Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

<NAME/> --

We need to make some decisions very soon (this morning) about <NAME/>'s submission of data into the Pacific Northwest ("PNW") refund case.  The data is due at FERC no later than Thursday August 16.

The key strategic issues in submitting the data to the ALJ include the following --

1.	Do we exclude bookouts (ie, only physical transactions)?

It appears that other market participants intend to exclude bookouts.  EPMI should also exclude bookouts given that these transactions never went physical and hence are not appropriate to consider in this case.

2.	Do we provide only sales transactions or do we include our purchases?

The ALJ's Order allows parties to include purchases only if the selling party is not an intervenor in this case and hence, our purchase would not be included in the data.  The ALJ wants to limit the amount of data to be provided to ease the workload.  Our initial analysis of some data from other parties is that there will be transaction data irregularities and hence, we should provide all of our relevant sales and purchases.  By having the data in the case, we can dispute any inappropriate transaction and ensure that all of our purchases are included in the calculation of refunds.  This is key for <NAME/> in that our primary defense is that <NAME/> deserves refunds as a purchaser to offset any sales refund amount.

3.	Do we provide data for all 4 time blocks (through 24 hours, through 7 days, through one month, through 1 year)?

The ALJ's Order indicates that parties are to provide data for transactions that are not consistent with the initial definition of "spot" - deals less than 24 hours done day ahead or day of.  Our initial recommendation is to provide the data but to retain our arguments that this is not consistent with FERC's Order.  The primary downside of not complying with this element of the data submission request is that we anger the ALJ and end up providing the data anyway after being told directly to comply.  In addition, it is possible that by providing all of the data we could be creating the problem that some economist or competitor could get their hands on the data at a later date and "determine" our trading strategies.  Weighing these risks, I would still recommend to include this data but argue before the ALJ and the FERC the ultimate relevance.

4.	Do we provide data based on contract date? 

The ALJ has requested data for contracts that were valid on December 25, 2000 that had physical energy flowing after December 25, 2000 through June 20, 2001.  This would explicitly include Balance of the Month transactions for December 2000 and the associated physical flows. To minimize the hours on these transactions, we intend to enter the transaction date in the data submission to allow for FERC staff to delete inappropriate transactions.

I will call you this morning.  

Thanks,

<NAME/>

<NAME/>,

I just wanted to let you know that I have been playing telephone tag with a couple of the Questar folks.  For the most part, they were out of the office several days during the last two weeks (of course I was out of pocket a couple days, too) .  I've left another message with <NAME/> Schmitt, who apparently is out of town yesterday and today, but I did hear from <NAME/> <NAME/> Olson, who was also in our office when <NAME/> came in several weeks ago.  <NAME/> <NAME/> is tracking down the status of the Western Leg information that <NAME/> requested.  I also let her know that we are interested in the Eastern Leg as well.  She will begin pulling that information together, too.  I expect to hear from her either later today or tomorrow with a status and timing of the data.  She will also connect up with <NAME/> when she sees him.  I will keep you posted as I hear more information.

Also, <NAME/> Starley (who is also in the Questar Marketing department), is looking for me to begin the Interconnect Agreement for the San <NAME/> Hub connect with Southern Trails .  Do you have a problem if I begin the paperwork, however, I have several other Interconnect Agreements that are higher priority at this time and it may take a while to get to this one?  I recognize that this is a delicate balance.

Thanks, <NAME/>.

Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PGandE).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC "overpayment".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC "overpayment"?  

On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the "overpayment" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.

Hey <NAME/>,

Of course I remember you! And you were right, Saturday the 25th was my birthday(37).  I feel especially old
now that I am surrounded by 24year olds.  I wish some old people like you were still around.

How dou you like Phoenix? and SRP?
And how is your family getting along?

<NAME/>,

By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.  Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.  It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.  The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.  If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.

I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.

We are looking at putting the metering facilities on their ROW (also, I think we will have to purchase about 50ft of ROW from ElPaso to get to Questar's property).  As you look at this, if for some reason we cannot obtain ElPaso ROW, we will have to look at Plan B which would be to put the metering on our ROW.  Our in-service date is May 1.  If you think that May 1 may be difficult due to receiving the parts/materials on a timely basis because of the issues that vendors may have with us because of recent <NAME/> events, please let me know.  Questar has already informed us that they would help obtain parts/materials to our specifications if it helps achieve an in-service date of May 1.

FYI, the attached article and story is disturbing and surprising about Southern Company.
 
It also raises an issue that we could face if we are not careful.  The article discusses internal diversity studies, which the plaintiffs are using as evidence to support their claims.  The company claims that the studies were done by people who did not know how to conduct the appropriate analyses under the relevant legal standards.  
 
I have this concern here, as well, when we have people running analyses that do not factor in the legal standards and instead try to interpret data themselves.  I would like to talk about how to manage that.  Let me know who you think should be included in such a meeting, and I'll set something up.

<NAME/>:

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

Sorry for rambling.

Just to clear up a mis-understsanding.

Netco does not have any disaster recovery facilities, equipment, software or people.  It is true to say that Netco is getting everything we have but we never had disaster recovery.  Netco is not getting additional equipment that the estate has to provide this function in the future either as it would mean the estate would lose functionality.

In terms of our budget we only have a place holder for $10mm in the budget which <NAME/> assumes would cover equipment and licences but not facilities or ongoing costs.  Assumption is that we would take this year to get it in place and budget for next year.  We really are guessing too as we never had this facility before.

Attached is TW revenue detail by contract for the years 1997-2000.   At the bottom of the schedule, I've made a simplistic cut between short-term/long-term based on the expiration date.  

For example, for calendar year 1997:
Short-term  = Firm contracts with contract expiration date before 12/31/98  + all IT and PNR revenues
Long-term = Firm contracts with expiration dates in 1999 and beyond.


Same logic for years, 1998, 1999, 2000.

FYI.  See highlighted comments below.  <NAME/>'t know if you've heard, but there's considerable talk about <NAME/> trying to get the bonds out via Executive Order.  How that might work technically is unclear---at the end of the day, Lynch and Co. have to approve any ratepayer funds used to service the bonds.  Perhaps <NAME/> is thinking about shifting the burden to taxpayers generally.  In off line conversations with JP Morgan people, they're saying the Executive Order route is "doable," but they ain't giving any details.  We're trying to find out more.
Alternative SDGandE debt plan to get hearings 
Approval of the governor's plan for paying the $747 million debt SDGandE says it is owed by its customers appeared less certain yesterday, as the president of the state utilities commission said she planned to hold public hearings for an alternative proposal. 
<NAME/> Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said in a local radio interview that regulators will hold hearings in San <NAME/> regarding a plan from consumer groups that purports to save customers about $185 million more than the governor's proposal. 
The groups said the earlier plan negotiated between the governor and the utility would be costly for consumers and a windfall for San <NAME/> Gas and Electric. 
At stake is how much SDGandE contributes and how much customers pay toward the debt, which accumulated in a so-called balancing account when SDGandE paid more for electricity than it was able to collect from customers during the power crisis. 
Despite the plan for hearings, Lynch told KPBS-FM radio that the commission would make a final decision about how to resolve the controversial $747 million debt by November. 
The governor and SDGandE announced their plan in June, saying it required the utility to contribute $319 million toward the debt and eliminated the balancing account without lengthy litigation or raising rates. 
Consumer groups, led by the San <NAME/>-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, say the governor's plan does not go far enough, particularly because SDGandE earned an estimated $400 million in profits from the sale of electricity during the power crisis. 
Under the governor's plan, those profits are awarded to the company's shareholders, though SDGandE would use $219 million from the profits as part of its $319 million contribution toward the debt. 
Under the consumer groups' plan, SDGandE would be allowed to keep some of the profits, but it would contribute $72 million more than it would under the governor's plan. The alternative plan also would require the utility to make other monetary concessions. 
In a formal decision earlier this year, the California utilities commission said SDGandE's profits do belong to customers. SDGandE has sued to overturn the decision in court, but it has put the litigation on hold pending the utilities commission's resolution of the plan to pay the debt. 
<NAME/> Shames, executive director of UCAN, said yesterday that he was encouraged by Lynch's call for hearings on the consumer plan. 
"There is $400 million at stake here," Shames said. 
SDGandE said yesterday that it had not received formal notification about the hearings, nor had it yet seen the alternative plan for paying the debt. 
A spokesman for the utility, however, repeated earlier comments that the company saw the alternative plan as an attempt to derail the PUC's process of considering the governor's plan. 
Lynch also said yesterday that the utilities commission would continue to challenge the more than $40 billion in long-term electricity contracts signed by the state during the crisis. 
Lynch said the agreements bind the state to overpriced power and are in violation of federal law requiring electricity rates to be "just and reasonable." 
The utilities commission president said the contracts may be even more expensive than earlier thought because at least some of the power they bind California to purchase is not needed. The extra costs would damage businesses and family budgets, she said. 
"If you have to pay three to four times more for energy, you don't have the money to grow your business or meet other needs of your family," Lynch said. 
She also defended action by the commission last week that effectively delayed the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds needed to pay power costs. Lynch said the commission supported a legislative proposal for floating the bonds, which would separate them from the long-term power contracts.

This looks very good.  One suggestion:  May be a little ambitious to do #2, and really ambitious to do #2 for the entire West.  May want to priortize in some small way, like, what are the 5 things that most affect the book (maybe confined to California?).  Just a suggestion.  I'm comfortable doing the whole nine yards.  Just concerned that we may fail to cover some really big risks that are lurking on the horizon in the near term if we choose not to focus down just a bit.

That said, seems real important to complete the comprehensive view as you've set out in the agenda as soon as we can (e.g., next four weeks, or so).

Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the <NAME/> MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, <NAME/> <NAME/>, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

<NAME/> will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job well done.  

We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to <NAME/>, who scoped out options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market


Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila


Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

There has been a little confusion about how this Counterparty wishes to be set up on EnronOnline, and after talking to the Counterparty, <NAME/> Vanek in Credit, and <NAME/> Cook we have come to the following agreement:

The counterparty will be (and I think already may be?) set up in the GCP System as Vector Pipeline, LP

I told the Counterparty that special Confirmation Templates would be prepared for this Counterparty and the signature line should be prepared as follows:

Vector Pipeline, LP, by its Managing General Partner,
  Vector Pipeline, LLC

By:  _____________________
Name:  __________________
Title:  ____________________

This form of signature block should be used for all EnronOnline and any offline trades for counterparty as well.

The Password Application has been executed by the Counterparty correctly so there is no need to have him re-apply.

Hey there, 
haven't done the recipes yet. I'm actually planning on doing just the chocolate one.  I am going to do another cake that is a white chiffon cake w/ white choc buttercream frosting.  It also has the buttercream/fresh berrries/ and seedless jam in the layers.  I'll let you know how that turns out.
My plan is to do the frostings/ganache on monday..and bake the cakes on tuesday...assemble wednesday.  I've been wiggin out about it because I am doing this to feed 30 people and I have not been practicing at all.......But....i slapped myself around yesterday to calm down and i'm ready for it.  I will do all the measuring on sunday too..so i think i'm giving myself enough time.  Wish me luck.

Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi.

I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.  My husband and son are staying back.  I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.   I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.  I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.  Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.  Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to <NAME/> around Dec 30.  This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.

I was just thinking about the December liquidations.  We moved many deals over to a book called Bankruptcy for december forward production months.  We won't be calculating this book but I'm wondering if the deals will still liquidate for <NAME/>'s (or whoever) schedule.  If they do, we will have huge OA because we killed the swaps on those physical deals, meaning the desk and customer prices will be the same.  We'll see those variances, and at the same time Financial acct. should see a variance because the deals liquidated but were not "flashed" in our PandL's.
 
How can we tell if that book will liquidate this month or not?

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with <NAME/> in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to <NAME/> at price x, that counterparty may not buy from <NAME/> at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with <NAME/> on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

<NAME/> and <NAME/>,

As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index deals.  Here are my thoughts...

For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San <NAME/> to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 could impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for this transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract will have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approximately 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over collected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have something less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collection.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assume after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seasonally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The remaining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. 

It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d of the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually burned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind fuel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actually used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not have additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity loss on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provided by the other in-kind shippers that we do not need for Dynegy on this particular day.  Now we are subject to selling this extra gas at current cash prices verses having the ability to hedge this volume ahead of time at a price that we felt meet our fuel hedging strategy, thus creating an opportunity loss. 

Would you agree that our risk is when Dynegy does not flow?  Would you agree that there is no additional price risk when Dynegy does flow? 

Thanks, <NAME/>.

The PUC's decision 1) suspending DA and 2) signaling the PUC's intent to continue to consider nullifying DA contracts signed after July 1 is full of holes.
We haven't detected any downside in joining with coalitions, and trying to get other coalitions, to appeal the PUC order.  
<NAME/> <NAME/> is working with the ARM coalition to appeal yesterday's order and is taking the lead generally on the effort to reverse things.
The appeals that we would join, and attempt others to persue on their own, would focus principally on two issues:  1) disabusing the PUC of the notion that it has the legal authority to nullify contracts retroactively, and 2) lifting the suspension on DA altogether (let me know if I've missed anything here, <NAME/>).

Please let us know if folks have any concerns that would cause us to reconsider pursuing these challenges.

<NAME/> is keeping us updated on Unify production problems, which unfortunately occur rather frequently.  When he cited the reason for performance issues in his orginal e-mail message below, I asked him whether or not the Unify team was aware ahead of time that the server resynchronization was being handled during normal business hours.  Here is his response.  I bring this to your attention not to create an issue, but rather to solve one.  I know that everyone is incredibly busy, but with so many interdepencies here we have to stay closely coordinated.  I know that EOL has a dedicated member of your team who is always on point and knowledgeable about infrastructure issues that could or do touch EOL.  Is there anyone assigned from your team for a similar role with our critical operating systems?  Because of nomination deadlines and the exchange of information with external parties for Unify, it can create real exposure (dollar exposure and PR exposure) if Unify's performance is impaired.  Let me know if you can assign someone from the infrastructure team that can wear the responsiblity of staying in step with Unify.  Thanks.  --<NAME/>

It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.

<NAME/>,

CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it more a
production tool.

We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM has)
in about two weeks, at request of <NAME/> Jones who joined EES from HSB. <NAME/>
worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar tool
for his projects with <NAME/>. I can tell you more about it when we meet (hopefully) later
this week. 

I would tell <NAME/> that the model requires more work before <NAME/> can
consider it as commercial product.

Bridgeline is a JV between <NAME/> and Texaco.  Currently, <NAME/> and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.

Thanks for the heads up on  9/01.  I'm printing the report right now and I'll get with <NAME/> tomorrow (she's out today).  If you would like to look at August that would be fine - I would just like to stress that changing any receipts will affect our purchases and likewise with our deliveries.

I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).

The message from <NAME/> about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the "health" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in "03 and beyond.  Finally, I think <NAME/> Whalley and <NAME/> Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).

Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (<NAME/> McGovern, <NAME/> Black's UVA classmate, and <NAME/> Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both <NAME/> and <NAME/> about your meeting here in <NAME/>.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to <NAME/> and she will check with <NAME/> concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  <NAME/> it is all going as smoothly as possible.  <NAME/> tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

"The Parties shall designate <NAME/> North America Corp. as the calculation agent for the purpose of determining Breakage Costs (such determination being final and binding on ECTRI, GSCI and the Parties) and <NAME/> North America Corp. shall take into consideration the two Quotations and the Estimate and any other information that it in good faith deems relevant."

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Let me know what you think.

How <NAME/> Blew It
Less than a year ago, the <NAME/>-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by <NAME/> Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. <NAME/>, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. <NAME/> is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating <NAME/> on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares <NAME/>'s simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as <NAME/> transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy," notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This <NAME/> was largely the creation of <NAME/> Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO <NAME/> Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, <NAME/> would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, <NAME/> could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, <NAME/> was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, <NAME/> wanted the first crack. And with each success, <NAME/> became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. <NAME/>, says Skilling, "was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets."
The <NAME/> story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, <NAME/> was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today <NAME/>'s stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast <NAME/> as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in <NAME/> threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which <NAME/> was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in <NAME/>'s fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it." At <NAME/>, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's <NAME/> Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, <NAME/> Skilling is no longer associated with <NAME/>, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next <NAME/> Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone could actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling <NAME/>.
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for <NAME/> caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that would not have been good for me."
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understanding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the <NAME/> Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about <NAME/> in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: <NAME/> boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in <NAME/>, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, <NAME/> Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, <NAME/> <NAME/>'s less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of <NAME/> was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being called "the merger" back in <NAME/>, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and <NAME/>, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, <NAME/> Lay was running a new company called <NAME/>. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future," says one person associated with <NAME/> at that time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? <NAME/> was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, <NAME/> Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in <NAME/>, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his <NAME/> colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where <NAME/> Lay found him in 1985.
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. <NAME/> would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And <NAME/> would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 <NAME/> executives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked <NAME/> Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around <NAME/> was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined <NAME/> as the head of <NAME/> Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, <NAME/> not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, <NAME/> could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-<NAME/> could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within <NAME/>, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by <NAME/>'s employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "<NAME/> was going to create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, <NAME/>, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like <NAME/> Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, <NAME/> people were also supposed to be "aggressive." You were right for <NAME/> if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the <NAME/> headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at <NAME/> was called "a sense of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work <NAME/> before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing <NAME/> would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (<NAME/> people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, <NAME/> offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at <NAME/> offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for <NAME/> never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join <NAME/>'s Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, <NAME/> offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money," says <NAME/> Rice, who stayed with <NAME/> for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to <NAME/>: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say," one loyalist says.
And why not? By 1995 <NAME/> had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for <NAME/>), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to <NAME/>'s generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably <NAME/> Skilling. In 1997 <NAME/> Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as <NAME/> Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: <NAME/> and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; <NAME/> Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within," sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, <NAME/> Corp is that gate-crashing <NAME/>," crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and <NAME/>, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, <NAME/> was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an <NAME/> client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was <NAME/>'s entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, <NAME/>Online became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. <NAME/>, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To <NAME/>, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So <NAME/> created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. <NAME/> looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason <NAME/> did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But <NAME/> had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them "counterparties."
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from <NAME/> because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because <NAME/> invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, <NAME/> could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all.
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-market accounting," for instance, <NAME/> used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always <NAME/>'s idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, <NAME/> took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. "<NAME/> is known for leaving people at the altar," says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to <NAME/>'s attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the <NAME/> READ Commission, a literacy group, called on <NAME/> for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for <NAME/>'s competing literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away for <NAME/> was supposed to make money for <NAME/>," he says.
As <NAME/> became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the <NAME/> family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change started at the bottom. As <NAME/>'s domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's <NAME/> spies reported overhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an intelligent slave, quick." <NAME/> had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, <NAME/> had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, "<NAME/> viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become <NAME/>'s attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an <NAME/> higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: "They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became an <NAME/> clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says one former <NAME/> executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at <NAME/>, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death."
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where <NAME/> once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been <NAME/>'s pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the time for long-term approaches," an <NAME/> executive says of Wall Street's mood. "It was the technology era."
To rid <NAME/> of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on <NAME/> <NAME/>, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. <NAME/> was for many years the poster child for the <NAME/> way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was <NAME/> the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. <NAME/> was largely responsible for the success of <NAME/> International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of <NAME/>'s profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one <NAME/> executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then <NAME/> ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, <NAME/>, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the <NAME/> way: Taking <NAME/> into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make <NAME/> and other <NAME/> plants around the globe successful did not mesh with <NAME/>'s goals, and Skilling's impatience with <NAME/> grew.
Forcing <NAME/> out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was <NAME/> didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as <NAME/> could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically <NAME/>ian: They gave <NAME/> her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, <NAME/> spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as <NAME/>'s entry into the emerging world of water privatization. <NAME/> was put in charge of making <NAME/>, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.
But <NAME/> had to succeed on <NAME/>'s increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. <NAME/>'s resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into <NAME/>. "I think it's best for <NAME/> to start afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to <NAME/>, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December <NAME/> Lay announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well," he told the press. "<NAME/> is doing extremely well now." In February 2001 <NAME/> Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. <NAME/>'s domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on <NAME/>, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and <NAME/>'s political action committee are the top contributors to <NAME/> W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding <NAME/> for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within <NAME/>, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The <NAME/> plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within <NAME/>'s management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite <NAME/>'s claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray <NAME/> did a very good job of blaming us," says <NAME/> <NAME/>, a vice president for corporate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray <NAME/>." (California utilities still owe <NAME/> $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down with its lights on.")
But the biggest problem was <NAME/>'s telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that <NAME/> could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. <NAME/> estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, <NAME/> had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, <NAME/> suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep <NAME/>'s most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged <NAME/>'s financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of <NAME/>'s accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "There wasn't any positive news," <NAME/> Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether <NAME/> was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does <NAME/> make its money?") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, <NAME/> Lay and <NAME/> Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against <NAME/>'s possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. <NAME/>, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting," says <NAME/> Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight."
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful <NAME/> executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at <NAME/> says. "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"
Loyalty had never been prized at <NAME/>, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as one <NAME/> oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad."
As it turned out, that description applied to <NAME/> Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, <NAME/> was over. Ever stoic, <NAME/> Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler <NAME/> in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovate much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem."
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with <NAME/>, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even <NAME/>'s biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he says with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in <NAME/>. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world." <NAME/>, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
"This is the second wave, and <NAME/>'s got it," he says, almost breathless. "There are thousands of people running around the streets of <NAME/> that get it."

<NAME/>,

Your mom gave me your email address and said that she mentioned that I would be emailing you.   

This summer, my husband, <NAME/> Erb, and I hosted a 4-year old girl named <NAME/> from an orphanage in Taraz.  She came to us as part of Kidsave International's summer miracle program.  She returned with her group back to the orphanage at the end of August.  We miss her terribly.  

We have been working anxiously to complete our dossier and our INS approvals to be able to bring <NAME/> back to our family permanently.  Obviously world events have us very anxious about the adoption.  We are just as resolved to bring <NAME/> home and I'd leave tomorrow if I had all the approvals.  My hope was lifted by hearing that you were able to travel home to Kazakstan last week.

We are working with an adoption agency called Across the World Adoptions.  Their Kazakstan agents are Sergei Pikalov and Larisa Reznikova.   <NAME/>'s orphanage in Taraz is called Ulan and this was the first time they ever participated in a summer program to send kids to the US.  There isn't any way for me to call or mail <NAME/> now that she is back in the orphanage.  I am so fortunate that I am able to correspond via email with Sergei's wife (<NAME/> -- different <NAME/>) who was here this summer as a host with the kids.  <NAME/> and Sergei live in Almaty.  <NAME/> is a medical student.  She is rapidly improving her English through her visit and our continued correspondence.  Yesterday I was so touched that <NAME/> sent me a photograph of <NAME/>.  Sergei was in Taraz last week and saw dear <NAME/> and she is well.

Sorry for the long-winded background.  I hope you won't mind corresponding with me and offering me some travel advice.  

In His Name,

Im sure hes going through a tough period now.  If you saved his address you may want to congraulate him into the family.  Thanks for the prayers.  Its funny, but Im not too shook up about this.  what ever happens happens and I know I cant do anything about it.  It must the the Spirit within me, but Im relatively calm about the whole situation.  I find that when I hang aroundthe guys in the office and we start gripping, I loose my focus and start looking like a carnal <NAME/>ian.  So Im better off away from the troops and just trnding to business.  <NAME/> <NAME/> seems to be pretty focused also. Im glad for that.  I know hes under a lot of stress.     

It seems the people tied to the pipeline assets are the safest.  If it is a business unit with income coming in, <NAME/> wants you.  The gossip and garbage going around about what and how <NAME/> is going to do to bail itself out is rampant.  I just know that there arent too many people loyal to <NAME/> right now. Many fortunes and retirements have been lost and many of those who had retired in the last several months are trying to get back on with the different companies.   Someone said 4500 people in <NAME/> <NAME/> were given pink slips.  This is a bad time for all with Christmas around the corner, but then maybe, just like September 11, maybe its another wake up call for people to understand that the things in this world arent very stable and reliable.  I hope that this turns many to <NAME/>.  Another one of those Romans 8:28 passages which seems to have direct relevance right now.  If you can, say a prayer for those that arent employeed anymore and feel like they have lost everything.

I wanted to make sure that everyone is on the same page related to utility costs in California.  These costs may be (will be?) collected  from some utility customer, potentially including direct access customers.


Bucket #1	Utility Undercollection Feb 1, 2000 Through Jan 18, 2001

About $12.0 Billion (this money includes our Negative CTC amounts).  Should be financed through corporate debt.  No securitization.

<NAME/>'s Position:	Bundled service on Jan 1, 2001 pays fixed c/kwh

Bucket #2	CDWR Cost from Jan 5, 2001 through Bond Issuance or March 31, 2002

About $12.5 Billion  (about $10 Billion for spot purchases and $2.5 Billion for long-term buys)

<NAME/>'s Position:	Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) for all residential and small customers.  Larger customers are assigned direct responsibility for the Undercollection on c/kwh.  Balancing account for holding Utility even.  

Bucket #3	Prospective Generation Costs for Bundled Service Post March 31, 2002

URG 	= $40/mwh (retained generation and bilateral contracts)
CDWR 	= $120/mwh
QF 	= $100/mwh  

TOTAL 	= URG*%sales + CDWR*%sales + QF*%sales
	= $90/mwh


Bucket #4	AB1890 Non-Generation Stranded Costs



Bucket #5	AB1890 Generation Stranded Costs

<NAME/>:

With everything else going on, I apologize for raising this issue, but I'm concerned that if I don't, it may fall through the cracks.

I just realized over the weekend that within the next few weeks, I will have paid the full balance on tuition for the Fall 2001 semester in Berkeley's MBA program that I've been in since 1999.  (By the end of this semester, I will have finished 37 of the 40 units that are required to complete the program).

Naturally, I'd like to get reimbursed for the Fall semester's tuition, but I'm concerned that recent events create uncertainty at just about every level of the company.  

I know you've got a hell of alot on your plate right now, so there's no need to discuss immediately.  I simply wanted to get it on the radar screen.  Whenever you get a free minute, give me a ring and we can talk about it further. Take care, and thanks for listening.

Hi, Connie!!  Sorry I didn't get back to you on Friday.  Things got busy. 

The stock is still going down, but not as much.  It's at $13.92 right now, yippee!!!  I'm hoping all the skeletons are out of the closet now.  I guess I'll be working another 5 years or so -- I don't think the stock will get back to $45 or $50 until then.  There aren't any new businesses for <NAME/> to get into to make the stock analysts excited.  All the money we're making in trading is apparently not doing it for them. 

Who knows what will happen to the executives who are still here?  It might be hard to get a concrete case against them.  I'm sure some of them are in the same boat as the rest of us.  Oh, news flash....ENE $13.80.....I think Wall Street wants <NAME/> Lay's head on a platter.  I'm sure the stock analysts are really frustrated that <NAME/> Skilling isn't here anymore --- they would have gutted him.  Old Skilling is just grinning in his new <NAME/> Oaks mansion.  I think I would gut him if I crossed paths with him.  I think I should sign up for anger management classes. 

As for my car purchase.... yes, I traded in my Land Cruiser for a Toyota Sequoia.  I got a really good deal on my trade-in and paid cash for the balance.  Two days later, Renato found out from his new boss that Renato's position was superfluous.  This boss is the only Entergy guy to survive the Entergy-Koch trading merger.  They put him in between Renato and his former boss, and this guy decided that they didn't need both of them.  Entergy-Koch is so small that there aren't any other comparable positions open.  The guys working for Renato are sick about it.  The upper management at Entergy-Koch has done a review of this Entergy guy since he told Renato to take a hike ---everyone, peers and employees, told management in the review process that the guy was a two-faced loser with zero personality. Of course, now, Renato has already signed off on his settlement agreement; plus, he'd never consider going back.  They are paying him through the end of the year and vesting him in all the savings plans.  They are also paying him a year's salary, and he's currently doing a consulting job for the pipeline.  He's been actively looking for a new job.  Hopefully, he'll find one, or I'll be working until I'm 70!!

Oh, well.  Maybe I'll have some good news next time.....

Hey y'all,

Please, comply with the following request from Eservices.  Let's run through the paces every a.m.  In addition, please review the previous Manitoba Business Procedures. 
Thanks,
<NAME/>


An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba (MHEB) has been signed and begins tomorrow, November 1st.  In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB may frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savings with MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc. I realize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much business with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are working on other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this deal will affect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate information with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, please maintain the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/MHEB Price Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hourly and next day, record any relevant market information (see the log for examples). Include responsibility for handling MHEB in the daily transition to the night shift.  <NAME/> will coordinate these efforts. Please call me (cell - 713-962-0526) with any questions.  Thank you!

<NAME/> --

Given our current situation at <NAME/>, I wanted to let you know that we will not be able to support the SE RTO Study.  I assume that you were already thinking this.  This upcoming week should prove to be another amazing ride.  

As soon as we come up for air, I'll call and fill you in on the developments.

I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.

I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.

This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.

Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:

11/13/01	4,069:72
11/10/01	21,010:15
11/10/01	3,319:40

Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.

In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.

In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.

Down to brass tacks, eh?  This is always the interesting part.  Quite frankly <NAME/>, it's a pretty good job market.  Basically I'm looking at two other prospects.  The first will require me to sign a 2-year contract, the second will not.  The base component with the first is going to be around $275/year.  The second is going to be around $250/year.   As far as incentive bonus goes, I'm looking at about a minimum of $450 for the first to about a max of $750.  At the second I'm looking at a min of about $350 to about a max of $900.  So over a one year period, we're looking at about $725 to $1.025M for prospect 1, and $600 To $1.15M for prospect 2.

In terms of location, both prospect 1 and 2 are in attractive locations for me.  Prospect 1 is in a VERY attractive location.  To be honest, I'm not a big buyer of <NAME/>, so I have to factor that into the equation.  Secondly, both prospects are big, well entrenched players, so I'm pretty confident of the above numbers.  While I'm pretty excited about the prospects of being on the "ground floor" with Cinergy, I also have to recognize Cinergy doesn't have a PandL track record for me to assess the probability of the incentive payout.  For that reason, I think, I would require a fairly large guaranteed number the first year, while still participating in Cinergy's incentive program.  The second year I would be willing to renegotiate the guaranteed number if we had our feet underneath us and it looked like we had the room to prove ourselves and generate some serious money for the company.

Given what you guys have in mind, I honestly think I can help you achieve your goals more quickly, and with less risk.  I also think there is serious money to be made with the right team--I've seen it happen at <NAME/>.

No matter what happens, I appreciate you taking the time.  Please also extend my thanks to everyone I had the opportunity to meet in Cincinnati.

The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

<NAME/> Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for <NAME/> Hall/<NAME/> Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by <NAME/>).  By copy of this email, I will ask <NAME/> Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting <NAME/>/<NAME/> to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

You know what is more recently?  Reason I ask is that in the past, when volumes have been low, SoCal's had to "prop up" flows, i.e., keep a minimum at Blythe for "operational reasons" to serve San <NAME/> (they said).  So (just to give them the benefit of the doubt), I was wondering if there might be something to that recently.  Pure speculation, but wondering if you had any info.  Because I certainly can't think of ANY other reason for their behavior.  I'm calling another PUC staffer today to discuss. In the meantime, are we continuing to make the request to SoCal for service?  Might be a good idea to keep doing that.

Luiz --

Yes there has been a shift in the thinking - away from the "natural gas" model and toward the financial structure.  Some of this is related to the political realities of the US market and FERC.  Some is that our traders in the East are comfortable with PJM and have been making term markets at PJM West hub.  All of this assumes that we should be able to migrate to a more physical model if the industry needs to later.

I do think that it would be helpful for you to get together and work up a discussion for all Government Affairs to explain the key differences and what policy discussions we need to focus upon - (i.e., setting up good "hubs" and auctioning transmission rights).

Also, I think that any thoughts you have on the implications for EES are important.  Not sure that either model is really "great" for competitive retailers.  The difficulty is that our predictions of load and the actual usage will always be different.  As long as (1) our analytics have the data to "price" basis between hubs and from a hub to a customer and (2) there is no discrimination in allocation of transmission rights then our ability to sell at retail will be competitive.

The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.  
Password Application	-  In writing
Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically

These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.

All deals have been moved to ENA-IM WEST last night.  Set up your physical post-id's for today and calculate the weapon-X, make sure there are no deals in your books using a forwards detail.

Couple thoughts.  Understanding that we're really trying to get this thing done and that there's a million different ornaments one could hang on the tree (and bring the thing toppling down), I'll just throw this out for consideration.

Seems that as a first-order issue, the judge is either going to approve the settlement or cede to arguments the PUC could make regarding its exclusive ratemaking authority--that is what it is.
Assuming that the judge sides in our favor, there remains the chance that the PUC could take the <NAME/> view and charge DA customers for the undercollection, thereby taking back what we achieved in the settlement based on the way our deals are structured with our customers.
It would help alot if PGandE took the position at the PUC that (for a variety of reasons) the PUC should NOT tack on DA customers' bills any charges designed to pay down the utilities' undercollection.
In a proceeding where <NAME/> and PGandE are on different sides, our chances of prevailing are of course much better.
But it likely won't do much good if we have any such deal written explicitly in the settlement document (i.e., PGandE agrees to take our side at the PUC).
But if there's any way to do some sort of side deal, outside of the settlement agreement, and if PGandE were amenable, there might be some real value.

Again, I know we want to get this thing wrapped up, but thought I'd toss it out there.  We can take it or leave it.

Best,
<NAME/>

I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously played by <NAME/> with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscore the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my operations team.  One of the roles that <NAME/>'s team fulfilled was keeping my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can have an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once in passing.  I checked with <NAME/> Gossett and <NAME/> White, risk leads over gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  Although <NAME/> Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the right players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within operations.  --<NAME/>

Existing includes Gallup, and it will be nearly imposiible to identify it as separate because there have been some changes to the original contracts for Gallup.   You can try, but now you are talking about getting into parts of contracts.    You have to remember it was an expansion, not a separate system and therefore there is no way to track the flows after the fact.

Dinner is still on for Tuesday, October 16 with <NAME/> May and the three scholarship recipients.  One student, Holland Brown, will join us a little late, as she has class until 8:00 pm.  I sent a note to <NAME/> May reconfirming the dinner and the time (7:00 cocktails and 7:30 dinner).  Seven other faculty/staff members are included on the invitation list, although I am awaiting a response from <NAME/> May on any changes or additions to that list of UT attendees.  

I have booked The <NAME/> House again - yes, third year in a row, but it has worked well and hopefully those of us who are yearly attendees don't mind the repeat!  You, <NAME/> and I took the the scholarship winners to Sullivan's late in the spring.  

Planned invitees from <NAME/> are you, me, and <NAME/>, plus the two others who interviewed candidates for the scholarships - Loftis Fitzwater (one of the first year winners) and <NAME/> <NAME/>.  <NAME/> Ondrecko was the fourth interviewer, but is obviously not included.  

Others that we could include are <NAME/> Lemmons, as AA program head, <NAME/> Glissan, as the MBA executive lead for UT, and <NAME/> <NAME/> from University Affairs (frankly, though, I haven't been able to get University Affairs remotely interested in this event, even though <NAME/> <NAME/> on their staff last year planned the dinner).  

Per your note, we could certainly include anyone else who may be helping us with interviews at UT.  <NAME/> says she will be busy that night making phone calls for 2nd round interviews, and she plans to have our analysts go to dinner with our summer interns who are back on campus.  Checking the list of "more senior" interviewers who could be included for dinner, it looks like <NAME/> Apollo, Randy Petersen, <NAME/> Shively, and <NAME/> Piper.  <NAME/> has checked with <NAME/> about interviewing - he can't do it.

13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts

    By Andrei Khalip
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes.
    Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months.
    "Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face," said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities.
    "And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter."
    The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage.
    Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country.
    Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses.
    "It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected," said <NAME/> de la Pena of Banco Santander. "I think we can say that they are suffering the most."
    Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing.
    GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT
    Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and   Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit.
    Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program.
    The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year.
    "This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again," said Telles. "But they just have to wait till next year.
    Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year.
   In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues.
    In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay.
    "Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed," said another analyst.

<NAME/> made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from <NAME/> Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with <NAME/> <NAME/> (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then <NAME/> could help in the process of interviewing <NAME/> for a position.  My last conversation with <NAME/> Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with <NAME/>.  --<NAME/>

<NAME/> Day and I talked.  <NAME/> agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PGandE to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, <NAME/> also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PGandE will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PGandE's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PGandE responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.

I think we urgently (next 2 days) need to have a meeting to discuss where we allocate capital and risk. Counterparties are very nervous and many are not extending us credit so we are having to prepay extensively to do business, both in the US and UK. I have two suggestions:

-allocate to each business a fraction of our available liquidity
or
-appoint someone to make the call when a large chunk of cash is needed.

For example, EGM wants to send out $200- $300 million for sixty days to buy physical to cover an option with Koch. 

We do not have infinite liquidity and we need to address it fast. I will try to set up a meeting tomorrow.

the curve has an adjustment of 0.025 cents

Our Mothers were best friends when we grew up in C.B.   His mother loved us and that created some competitive spirit between us.  I beat <NAME/> in 6th grade in a run for student Council at Hoover.

<NAME/>,

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who
faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna
from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects.

A brief outline of the facts.

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years
ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival
was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy
is also very complicated.

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a 
tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the
term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with
the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted.

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an 
outstanding contribution to <NAME/> (he is currently a VP) and to the American 
society. I am sure that <NAME/> Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his 
behalf to the State Department.

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational
approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run.

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's
behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. 
I shall fax to you a copy of the decision.

Thanks.

Why not use the actual correlations we have observed over the past 18 months.   Simply calculate forward gas price movement to forward power price movement (Bal 01, 02, 03, etc.)on a curve by curve basis, and you will find gas/power correlations on a forward basis are very high (80+%), at least in the Eastern markets.

EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
The OandM/GandA graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.

Is there any way you could copy and send overnight to me the CIG invoices for the 33175000 contract from May, 2000 through January, 2001?

I am helping <NAME/> and <NAME/> reconcile the Citizens account.  It is changing over to Kinder Morgan effective Dec. 1 and we need to reconcile this account rather quickly.

I printed all other invoices on the Internet from CIG's website but they only go back 9 months.

Let me know if this is possible or where else I might find these.

Thanks,
<NAME/>

The latest information we have -- President Lynch of the CPUC said today that the vote on suspending DA would be taken tomorrow.  Proposed Decision remains at suspending as of July 1.

There is still a possibility that the CPUC will hold this vote.  In addition, there continues to be a legislative fix that could override this decision.

Please call with any questions.

No, I didn't see my mom for Mother's Day because they left early Sunday morning to go to New England for about 10 days.  So, I'm glad that they feel okay to travel!  We'll do something after they get back to celebrate both my birthday and Mother's Day.

My weekend was fine.  I didn't do anything exciting....didn't really feel like going out.  I did run both days and am starting back at the gym today so I can become superbuff.  I've lost 6 lbs during this whole thing at least.  Just 9 more lbs to my goal of 140.  I saw Rayfael Friday when he came over to bring me a birthday present (he didn't think I was home!)  Then I took him some stuff that was at my house yesterday and we hung out a little bit.  I'm still hoping there's a chance we can get back together, but I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  He definitely needs some time to himself and to get over this bout of depression.  I just hope that if he does, then he wants to get back together then, but I'm not sure he does.  We'll see.  I'm not interested in seeing anyone else right away, so I guess I can afford to give it a little time.  Can you put a spell on him?  hehehe

Of course, if we do get back together, that's bad news for the puppies.  If it did come to that, though, I would take them to doggie daycare during the day and they could stay outside at night - that wouldn't be so bad and they wouldn't be lonely.  Anyway, that's a BIG IF that I really shouldn't be concentrating on...so there.

How are things in Germany?  How was your trip to London?  I saw <NAME/> in the elevator here last week, but I didn't get a chance to talk to her.

Write back!!!

Unfortunately yes.  The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform unwind and liquidation functions.  The trading group, the group I am in, is really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probably be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.  I wouldn't mind that because they understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and fixed income.  This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about over leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as important as what to do in business.  99% of the folks are good hardworking people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company down.  It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off.  It was so sad.  Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options last year, but still lost a little 401 k dough, but I still have my health as my mom likes to say.  On a good note we got your picture of the little tike, looks great.  I hope all is going well and thanks for the e-mail.  Talk to you soon.

<NAME/>, what I have on my board is that when cubix did the test for 703 the engine load was 89%.  If Cubix is willing to provide us a report that shows the load on 703 to be greater than 90%, we've satisified the compliance testing for 703.  Id like to have a copy of the revised report to submit to the Air Quality Bureau for their records and the facility should also have copy.  My records show that the ceiling for using unit 702 is 68% load.  Under our agreement with the AQB, we can operate unit 702 ONLY UP TO A 68% LOAD.  Above this, we need to bring in Cubix or have a portable test completed to raise the ceiling of operation.  One other thing, there seem to be some confusion about which units are required to be tested at station 7.  I have a copy of the approval from the AQB about allowing us to test units 702 and 703 instead of 701 and 702.  Ill pass a copy of this letter on to anyone who needs it.

I reconciled my PandL and I am off from your final PandL number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final PandL number should be ~ $460,000.

Under new rules instituted this year by Commissioner <NAME/> Selig, an umpire can automatically eject a pitcher if he believes he's throwing at a batter. He does not have to issue a warning before an ejection. 
<NAME/> did not warn Mann for hitting Gonzalez or Cordova. 
"The umpire said Bartolo threw the ball at his head and that's an automatic ejection," said <NAME/>. "But the ball missed his head by three feet. It tipped off his bat." 
Colon said he wasn't trying to hit Servais. 
"I will protect my teammates," said Colon, speaking through bullpen coach/interpreter <NAME/> <NAME/>. "I can hit anyone I want at any time. That's why I feel bad. I wasn't trying to hit him. The ball slipped." 
Fryman defended his pitcher. 
"At no point, do I approve of throwing at someone's head," said Fryman. "But that pitch did not surprise anyone in the ballpark. Bartolo should not have been ejected. There should have been an immediate warning to each bench.

As you are now aware, the United Way Campaign has now kicked-off and RAC is very much an important part of the efforts and activities that have been and will be taking place.  First of all, Monday morning, each of you should have received a small package of Lego building blocks and a schedule of United Way activities for the week.  The building blocks symbolize <NAME/>'s commitment to "Building <NAME/>'s Future" with the United Way and the schedule outlines the coming activities that <NAME/> employees will be engaging in to show support for the United Way Agencies and the <NAME/> community.

To highlight this week's activities:

On Wednesday, August 8, many of our RAC colleagues will be participating in the 2001 <NAME/> Days of Caring.  The <NAME/> Corporate Team, of which RAC is a large and important part, will be providing assistance to the Jewish Community Center.  If you have already volunteered to play a role in this activity--thank you.  If you have not had an opportunity to volunteer and would like to, please contact any one of this year's RAC United Way Campaign Coordinators--<NAME/> Hudler, <NAME/> Phillips, <NAME/> Vanek, <NAME/> Smith, <NAME/> Caudle, <NAME/> Schultz or <NAME/> Schneider.

On Friday, August 10, <NAME/> will host an Appreciation Event in Antioch Park which will include a complimentary lunch from Chick-Fil-A and activities to celebrate <NAME/> employee efforts during the week.  Included in this event will be the Building Block Challenge contest featuring managers from around <NAME/> including <NAME/> Gorte and <NAME/> Schneider on the Corporate Team.  Please plan on coming out to join-in the celebration and support our colleagues.

Of course, underlying all of the planned activities is the financial need that the <NAME/> area United Way Agencies have for the Year 2002.  This year has been extraordinary due to the flooding and devastation experienced by the <NAME/> area during Tropical <NAME/> <NAME/>.  In addition to providing their typical day-to-day community services, many United Way Agencies played a crucial role in the recovery effort and still provide support to those affected by the storm.  A contribution to the United Way this year is as important as ever given the extraordinary need.  Remember approximately $0.90 out of every $1.00 go directly to benefit our friends, neighbors and fellow citizens in the <NAME/> area.  I sincerely encourage you to support RAC's objective of 100% participation in this aspect of the Campaign by making a contribution.  Contributions can be made by clicking on the <NAME/> Human Resources website at https://hrglobal.enron.com.

Thanks for your support. 

Best regards,

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind.  

I'm tired from moving.  <NAME/>'s moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  

you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  

count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or let me know where the website is, etc.    

i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.

I understand the control concern but it sure would allow us to be more efficient since Texas is small and clean (probably not a full time manager job).  He has not and will not be taking risk positions (at least not initially) he has been and will be trading our daily Waha phyical volumes.  If he evolved to a point where we wanted him to take risk positions we then could move him out of Risk.  What do you think?

If you don't think this will work let me know, but in that scenario I guess I would say don't count on <NAME/>.  I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.  I we go down that road then I feel like I need to run this by <NAME/> since he effectively will be cutting his ties to Risk and taking some career risk.  I am sure if it does not work out you or some other company would welcome <NAME/> in a risk role.  Let me know what you think or just call me and we can get together.

Capacity in the ECAR market is important from a reliability aspect.  For example we could sell totally synthetic tolls and they would not be as valuable as the toll  off a plant in the region. Thats where the capacity comes into play. Moreover as RTOs come in, there might be an explicit ICAP market for ECAR.

Hey,

You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  <NAME/>'t feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already!

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that <NAME/> openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.

"The Administration does not project that the State will need to make additional State loans to support the DWR Power Supply Program even if DWR does not issue its revenue bonds as planned during the 2001-02 fiscal year. DWR projects that its funds on hand at the date of this Official Statement and projected revenues appear to be sufficient to finance the Power Supply Program. The cash needs of the Power Supply Program depend, among other things, on future power purchase costs, the timing and amount of revenues from power sales, the availability of additional interim loans, and the timing of the issuance of revenue bonds by DWR. The Power Supply Act limits loans and advances from the State under the Power Supply Act after November 15, 2001, to amounts required for short-term cash flow purposes of no more than $500 million in the aggregate and requires repayment within 180 days. However, the Governor has the power under the Emergency Services Act to order additional loans or other advances to DWR if needed to further mitigate the emergency.

	The State expects to maintain adequate cash reserves to fund its normal operations during the 2001-02 fiscal year whether or not DWR repays the State loans during the fiscal year. The State plans to issue short-term notes to assure that adequate cash balances are maintained. The State has regularly issued short-term debt in the past to meet its cash flow needs. See 'State Indebtedness-Cash Flow Borrowings.'"

Regarding the Waha storage, the west desk does not have a strong need for this storage but we are always willing to show a bid based on the current summer/winter spreads and cycling value.  The following assumptions were made to establish our bid:  5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and withdrawal fees.  Also an undiscounted  June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 existed at the time of this bid.

Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above assumptions:  $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).  Demand charges only.

I am not sure if this is exactly what you need or not.  Please call or email with comments.

Today FOEX published its weekly index for pulp:

For the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again.  

NBSK was down $US0.48 or 0.1% after four weeks of price increases.
BHKP was Euro 466 down Euro 3.34. Expressed in US dollars BHKP was $US416.09 down $US2.33 or 0.56%.
These decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers, including Weyerhaeuser, to raise prices. This might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals  do not support the price increases in pulp. 


The average FOEX for October is:
NBSK: $US 460.68 up $10.26 from September
BHKP:$US 414.76 up $13.67 from the September level

A month or so ago, you requested access to sitara reports for me.  You said it was completed, but the icon on the sitara launch pad is still greyed out.  Can you please pass this on to the appropriate person.  Also, i still don't have access to TDS which we requested before last week.  Thanks.

I talked to <NAME/> Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a "paid invoices" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen <NAME/> or <NAME/> and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.
